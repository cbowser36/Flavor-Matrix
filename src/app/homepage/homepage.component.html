                 When is the last time you had a remarkable meal? A meal that made you feel something in your soul,
              that reminded you of a childhood memory or instantly gave you comfort after a hard day. These feelings
              don't happen all the time, it takes someone who truly understands flavor profiles to make a meal like 
              that. 
                Whose to say that person can't be you or me? Being good with food  is not something you are born with,
              it's a learned behavoir that takes a long time to perfect. Every chef will tell you to start with the 
              basics of flavor and that's where this site comes in! I am here to teach you all of the basics so you 
              can create that remarkable meal. 
                If you choose flavors i will start from the beginning with flavor profiles. Then you will get a list
              of pantry staples for your spice rack and how to use them in your cooking. If you already know that stuff
              then start with recipes and i have a list of easy recipes that are meant for flavor pairings. These recipes 
              will give you an awesome base for any meal.

              So which path do you want to go down... Flavors or Recipes?
